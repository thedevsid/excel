This code calculates the future value of an investment, given the initial principal amount, the annual interest rate, and the number of years. The code first defines a function called calculate_future_value(). This function takes three arguments: 
the principal amount, the interest rate, and the number of years. 

future_value = principal * (1 + interest_rate) ** number_of_years
The formula takes into account the fact that the interest earned each year is reinvested in the investment. The function then returns the future value of the investment.

The code then defines a main function. The main function simply calls the calculate_future_value() function with the specified values
